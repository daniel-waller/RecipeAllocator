# Recipe Allocation Algorithm

This algorithm checks to see if orders can be satisfied from stock.

It takes as inputs:
  1. a list of recipes with their stock level and meal type
  2. a list of orders by the meal type, the number of recipes, and the number of portions required.
  
It returns True if all the orders can be satisfied, and False otherwise.
